3D Brush - Fully Featured Prefab Painting Tool
v1.5 - Released 10/06/2017 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for your purchase of 3D Brush. This program allows you to quickly paint prefabs to your scene with all of the features you would expect and many more. Easy to use and intuitive controls. You can also create custom shapes which can then be used as stencils for painting or exclusion.


Notes
----------------------------------------
The default hotkey is currently set to the Ctrl/Command key but you can change this in the settings options and the program will remember your preferences.

Performace may be slower with the prefab group expanded in the hierarchy. Collapsing this group may help improve the performance of the program.


Todo List.
----------------------------------------
Procedural placement of prefabs
Advanced tapering of prefabs
Terrain detail brushes
